                                You should be aware that there are certain things that
                                MetaGaming Guild will not take responsibility for. Certain
                                functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                                internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                                by your mobile network provider, but MetaGaming Guild
                                cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                                functionality if you don‚Äôt have access to Wi-Fi, and you don‚Äôt
                                have any of your data allowance left.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you‚Äôre using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                                should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                                mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                                be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                                the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                                other third party charges. In using the app, you‚Äôre accepting
                                responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                                charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                                (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                                you are not the bill payer for the device on which you‚Äôre
                                using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                                received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                            </p>

                                Along the same lines, MetaGaming Guild cannot always take
                                responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                                make sure that your device stays charged ‚Äì if it runs out of
                                battery and you can‚Äôt turn it on to avail the Service,
                                MetaGaming Guild cannot accept responsibility.

                                With respect to MetaGaming Guild‚Äôs responsibility for your
                                use of the app, when you‚Äôre using the app, it‚Äôs important to
                                bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                                updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                                to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                                to you. MetaGaming Guild accepts no liability for any
                                loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                                relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
